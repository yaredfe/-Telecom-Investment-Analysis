# -Telecom-Investment-Analysis
This project features a detailed analysis of telecommunications data designed to assess investment opportunities in a telecom company. The project emphasizes gaining insights into user behavior, engagement, and experience through exploratory data analysis, clustering techniques, and predictive modeling.
### Key Explorations:
- **User Overview**: Identified the top 10 most-used handsets, top 3 handset manufacturers, and their top 5 devices.
- **Data Aggregation**: Analyzed user metrics such as session counts, total download/upload data, and overall data consumption.
- **EDA**: Addressed missing values, performed univariate and bivariate analysis, and computed essential statistics (mean, median).
- **Variable Transformation**: Segmented users into decile classes based on session duration and assessed data usage patterns.
- **Correlation & PCA**: Conducted correlation analysis on application usage data and applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to uncover data patterns.
